# Welcome! Read me!

Hello, prospector and fellows alike,

This website showcases an upcoming product, PomoFocus! An app that promote productivity and focus, 
PomoFocus features a pomodoro timer integrated with an interactive list.
This specific project enacts as the Landing Page, highlighting skills of Web Design and Web Devlopment.
The page was designed using Figma, with graphics retrieved from open-sources or created personally through Inkscape/Adobe Illustrator.
Currently, this project is developed using VS Code, along with the languages HTML and CSS, and eventually further interactivity with JavaScript.
All and any feedback or criticism is greatly appreciated!

Thanks for stopping by!
Brandon L.
